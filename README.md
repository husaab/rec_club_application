The following application was designed to keep track of finances of a recreational club and for each member involved in the club. Moreover, the app allows customers to create an account, delete their account, edit their account information, and pay their fees for each practice directly through the app. Coaches of the club are able to manually add or remove customers themselves, and send reminders/notifications to customers about upcoming practices to customers who wish to receive them. Additionally, customers who haven’t paid their fees for an extended period will be notified by the coach about their outstanding balance regardless if they wish to receive notifications or not. The treasurer of the club will be able to manage all the finances of the club directly through the app by receiving a pdf file of the balance sheet of the club outlining all of the revenues and expenses in the club along with payments that need to be made to the coaches of the club.

In order to start using the program, the user must download the program then run the program and the user will be prompted with a log-in screen to which the user can log-in their information if they are an existing user, if they’re not the user can then go to the sign-up page to create a new account. The user is then brought to the dashboard where they now have access to all the features of the program.

This delivery package includes a product backlog that contains the stories/tasks which will be attempted to be completed in this iteration along with the initial priority and estimated and actual amount of story points it will take for each task in this iteration. Also, it includes a test plan that describes the tests that will be run with the test conditions, test inputs, and expected outputs at the end of iteration 3.
